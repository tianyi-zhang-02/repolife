"""One page to hand a change over: `tessri brief --since <base>`.

A review brief is triage and check from one pair of analyses (the base of the change and the working tree, each
analysed once), composed into what a reviewer needs before opening the diff: the exact state the evidence describes
(base, HEAD, the commits on the way in their authors' words, the uncommitted files in scope), the changed files to
look at first with the reasons triage gives, what the change did to the structure, the candidate tests kept apart
from the checks the host actually ran, who can look, and what needs a person. It selects for reading and shortens
every list with its count; the JSON carries the whole `triage` and `check` objects, so nothing is filtered away.

What the host ran is the host's to say: `--ran` records one line per check, verbatim, and without it the brief says
that no check was recorded. An execution is never inferred from the candidate tests."""
