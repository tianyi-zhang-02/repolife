"""What a change did to the map of the repository.

`tessri scan` describes a repository as it is. This compares two states of it, the point where a branch left
its base and the working tree now, and reports what the change altered in structure: files nothing reaches any
more, modules that now depend on each other, imports of files the change deleted, and changed code that nobody
active maintains. It is meant for the moment an agent (or a person) finishes a task, before the change is merged.

The base is read from git objects into a scratch directory and analysed there; the repository itself is never
touched. Ownership comes from history up to the base, so the change's own commits cannot make its author the owner
of what they just changed. Everything is static imports: a change that is only wrong at run time shows nothing here.
