"""`tessri check --format sarif`: the change check as a SARIF 2.1.0 log, for tools that already read that format.

This is a rendering of the finished check result, nothing more: one finding becomes one result in the same order,
with the whole finding kept in a namespaced property bag, so the aggregate meaning of a finding ("4 files nothing
reaches") is not split into four look-alike alerts. The evidence is file-level, so locations name files and never a
line; a finding without a usable file has no location rather than an invented one. Nothing is read from the
repository: paths come from the check result, and a path that is deleted, absolute or climbs out of the root is
left out of the locations (it stays in the properties).

Some consumers refuse a result without a location (GitHub code scanning rejects the whole log). `locationless="omit"`
takes those results out of `results` for such a consumer, but only on request: the default keeps them, and an omitted
finding is not dropped from the document, it moves whole into the run's `properties["tessri/locationless"]`, where
the count of location-free findings is recorded either way. The gate (`--fail-on`) counts findings, not results, so
omitting changes what a consumer displays and nothing else.
