"""`tessri mcp`: the questions as Model Context Protocol tools, over standard input and output.

An agent that speaks MCP starts this as a subprocess and asks Tessri's questions as tool calls. Each tool is one
command: its result carries the command's `--format json` object as `structuredContent` and the command's text or
Markdown as `content`, both from one analysis, so the agent sees what the terminal shows. Nothing is written and no
network is touched. Every call sees the checkout as it is: an analysis is reused for a later call only while the
checkout's fingerprint (HEAD, the paths git reports as changed or untracked with their sizes and modification
times, the configuration files) is unchanged, and for at most an hour; a change query (`triage`, `check`, `brief`)
always reads afresh.

Two revisions of the protocol are spoken, because clients are on both: the 2026-07-28 revision has no handshake
(every request carries its version in `_meta`, and `server/discover` says what the server is), the earlier ones
open with `initialize`. Standard output carries protocol messages only; notices go to standard error. A mistake in
a call's arguments is a tool result with `isError`, in the sentence the command line prints; a malformed request,
an unknown method or an unknown tool is a JSON-RPC error."""
