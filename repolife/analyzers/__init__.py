"""Language analyzer plugin API.

The reachability engine (graph.py) knows nothing about any language. It consumes the
`LanguageResult` that an analyzer returns for the files it handles:

  edges      file -> files it depends on (imports, includes, requires ...)
  indirect   optional: the part of `edges` that no import statement makes: a parent package that runs as a
             side effect of `import a.b.c`, a name in a string, a dynamic import. Reachability counts these;
             the module graph does not
  roots      file -> why it is an entry point (script guard, main(), CLI entry ...)
  tests      files that are tests; code reached only from these is "test-only"
  unparsed   files the analyzer could not parse; they are treated as entry points
             so that nothing they might import is wrongly reported as unused
  resolve_reference
             maps a name found in config/scripts (`pkg.mod.Class`) to files
  provenance optional: file -> target -> the kind of evidence behind that edge, one of KINDS below, the
             strongest when several apply. `impact` uses it to follow only recognized dependency syntax
             on request; an analyzer that leaves it empty keeps working and its edges count as "unknown"

To support a new language, subclass `Analyzer` and register it, either in
`BUILTIN` below or from a third-party package through the `repolife.analyzers`
entry-point group (the entry point must resolve to an `Analyzer` subclass).
